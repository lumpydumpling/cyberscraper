Title: Active Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)
Text Content: OX’s AppSec Data Fabric continuously scans and consolidates your application security data; enhancing and correlating information to pinpoint and automate the remediation of your most critical risks.OX Security’s proprietary OSC&R framework, developed in collaboration with experts from Google, Microsoft, and GitLab, provides a comprehensive model to understand software supply chain risks. It’s focused on critical attacker techniques and behaviors. This ATT&CK-like open framework helps Security and Development teams contextualize risk and stay abreast of the latest attack trends.Director of Infrastructure at Tomorrow.ioHead Of Security at Playbook EngineeringHead of IT and Cybersecurity, CISO, DPO, ProxymityCISO at 888Former Director, NSADirector of Product Security at FICOOX provides full security coverage over the entire software pipeline, helping DevSecOps and security teams protect their organizations from the next celebrity attack.Stop accumulating security debt and automatically block vulnerabilities introduced into the pipeline, making security an integral part of the development process instead of an afterthought.Auto-discovery and mapping of all applications with full visibility & traceability over the software supply chain attack surface, including source code, pipeline, artifacts, container images, and runtime assets.Reduce manual work and automate protective actions like blocking the pipeline and code merges, making security an integral part of the development process instead of an afterthought.Manage findings, orchestrate DevSecOps activities, prevent risks and maintain software pipeline integrity, all from a single location.OX supports over 35 built-in compliance frameworks, such as NIST, SOC2 and GDPR, allowing compliance teams to continuously monitor, report on and improve compliance across the organization.Stop using tools without getting any value. Ox provides single-click Integration and invocation of open-source and commercial security tools, allowing DevSecOps to activate tools with minimal effort and zero friction.Visibility into software vulnerabilities while coding allows developers proactively respond and remediate potential threats pre-production, without impacting velocity.Bake security into your software pipeline. A single API integration is all you need to get started. No credit card required.
