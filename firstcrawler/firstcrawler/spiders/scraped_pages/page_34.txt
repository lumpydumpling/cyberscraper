Add the Navigation component to the Cupcake app to organize the flow of the app, navigate and pass data between different screens.                                                          Learn how to test the Navigation component and maximize code test coverage.                                                          Practice what you learned by adding navigation to an app with multiple screens.                                                          Great job with completing the second pathway in Unit 4! In this pathway, you learned about the Jetpack Navigation component which is a key library to build apps with more screens and to navigate between them.
