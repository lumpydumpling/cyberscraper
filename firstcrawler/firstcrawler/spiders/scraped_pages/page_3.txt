Title: How to Use Object-Oriented Programming in C# â€“ Explained With Examples
Text Content: Welcome to this comprehensive guide on object-oriented programming (OOP) using C#. This article will delve into the four fundamental pillars of OOP:Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a beginner stepping into the world of C#, this article aims to enhance your understanding of OOP concepts and their implementation in C#.If you're new to C#, consider taking the free certification course on freeCodeCamp or the free course on Microsoft Learn to familiarize yourself with the language.Remember, the principles of OOP are universal and apply to most object-oriented programming languages. Therefore, the knowledge you gain from this article can be applied to learning OOP in any language.Let's get started!What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)Why Use Object-Oriented Programming?The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented ProgrammingInheritanceTypes of InheritanceEncapsulationPolymorphismAbstractionSummaryObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses  and  to design and develop software applications. It is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions).Object-Oriented Programming offers several benefits, including:: OOP promotes modularity by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts (objects). This makes it easier to maintain and update the code.: OOP allows you to reuse existing code by creating new objects based on existing ones. This saves time and effort in developing new applications.: OOP provides flexibility in designing and implementing software systems. You can easily modify and extend the functionality of objects without affecting other parts of the system.: OOP supports scalability by allowing you to add new objects and classes as the system grows. This makes it easier to accommodate changes and enhancements in the software.As you can see, OOP offers several advantages that makes it a popular choice for developing software applications. Let's explore the four fundamental pillars of OOP in more detail.The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming are:These pillars form the foundation of OOP and are essential concepts to understand when working with object-oriented programming languages like C#.Let go deep into each of the pillars of OOP in the next sections.Let's start with the first pillar of OOP: .Inheritance is a concept used in most programming languages and is something you can't avoid when working with object-oriented programming. Programming languages like  and Java are some of the languages that support inheritance. In this article, we will be looking at inheritance in  and how to use it in your application.Imagine that you have a family tree, where each generation represents a class in C#. The first generation is the , which is the foundational class that provides the basic structure and properties. This could be likened to the patriarch of the family, who establishes the family's core values and characteristics.As the family tree progresses, each subsequent generation inherits the traits and characteristics of the previous generation but also adds or modifies them to reflect their unique identity. These subsequent generations can be thought of as  classes in C#, which inherit from the  class but also introduce their own unique features or modifications.For example, the patriarch might have established the family's love for gardening, which becomes a fundamental trait passed down through the generations. However, as the family tree evolves, some members might develop a special interest in growing exotic plants, while others might focus on organic gardening. These special interests represent the unique characteristics of the derived classes, which inherit the basic love for gardening from the base class but also introduce their own unique features.In this analogy, the  class is the patriarch, which represents the foundational class with its basic properties and characteristics. The  classes are the subsequent generations, each with their unique features or modifications, inheriting the basic traits from the base class but also adding their own unique aspects. This process of inheritance allows for the creation of a rich and varied family tree, where each generation builds upon the previous one, introducing new traits and refining existing ones.Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to define a new  based on an existing . The new class inherits all the members (fields, properties, and methods) of the existing class. The existing class is known as the  class, and the new class is known as the  class.Basic Syntax of inheritance in C#:In the above code snippet,  is the base class, and  is the derived class. The  inherits all the members of the . The colon  is used to indicate that the  is derived from the .If You are new to  and you don't know what a class is, don't worry, I will explain it to you. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object of the class will have. Here is an example of a class in :In the above code snippet, the  class has two properties ( and ) and a method (). The properties represent the state of the object, and the method represents the behavior of the object. You can create an object of the  class and set its properties like this:You can call the  method on the  object to display the name and age of the person:Before moving on with the article, let's look at some keywords you're going to come across  a lot ,  ,, , and .Let me explain them to you.So now you know what these keywords mean, let's move on to the next section.Inheritance can be classified into different types based on the way the classes are derived. The following are the types of inheritance:To illustrate this, let's consider a real-world analogy. Imagine you are the only child of your father. In this scenario, you inherit characteristics from your father. This is akin to single inheritance in programming.Let's look at an example in :In the above code,  is the base class with a method .Now, let's create a derived class  that inherits from the  class:In this code snippet, the  class is derived from the  class. The  class inherits the  method from the  class.You can create an object of the  class and call the  method. This demonstrates that the  class can access the  method from the  class.To better understand this, let's consider a family tree analogy. Assuming you are the  of your , and your  is the  of your . In this scenario, you inherit characteristics from both your father and grandfather. This is similar to multilevel inheritance in programming.Let's explore this concept with an example in :In the above code,  is the base class with a method .Next, we created a derived class  that inherits from the  class:Here, the  class is derived from the  class and inherits the  method from it.Finally, we created another derived class  that inherits from the  class:In this code snippet, the  class is derived from the  class. The  class inherits the  and  methods from the  class.We can create an object of the  class and call the  and  methods. This demonstrates that the  class can access the  and  methods from the  class.To illustrate this, let's consider a real-world analogy. Assuming you and your  share the . In this scenario, all of you inherit characteristics from the same parent. This is akin to hierarchical inheritance in programming.Let's explore this concept with an example in :In the above code,  is the base class with a method .Next, we created two derived classes  and  that inherit from the  class:In this code snippet, the  and  classes are derived from the  class. Both classes inherit the  method from the  class.We can create objects of the  and  classes and call the , , and  methods. This demonstrates that both  and  classes can access the  method from the  class.Congratulation you have learned the basics of inheritance in C#, let's move to the next section .As we continue our journey through the pillars of OOP, we now arrive at . Before we delve into , it's crucial to understand a common concept in C# called .Properties in C# are members of a class that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. They can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors. These accessors are used to get and set the values of private fields.If you're new to this concept, don't worry. Let's break it down with an example:In the above code snippet, the  class has a private field  and a property . The property  has two accessors: a  accessor to retrieve the value of the  field, and a  accessor to set the value of the  field.Understanding properties is key to grasping the concept of , which we will explore in the next section.To understand , let's use an analogy. Consider a  that contains a . The  acts as a container that encapsulates the . The  is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through the . This is akin to  in object-oriented programming. is the principle of bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a . It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and allows access only through the methods of the class. In essence,  conceals the internal state of an object and only exposes the necessary information to the outside world.Let's see an example in C#:In the above code snippet, the  class encapsulates the data (fields  and ) and methods () into a single unit. The fields  and  are private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. The properties  and  provide controlled access to the private fields using  and  accessors.Let's add another example to further illustrate this concept:In this example, the  class encapsulates the  field and the methods that operate on it (, , ). The  field is private and can only be accessed through the  property and the methods of the class. This ensures that the balance cannot be directly manipulated from outside the class, providing a secure way to manage a bank account.Congratulations! You have learned about  and how it is implemented in C#. Let's move on to the next section, .As we delve deeper into the four pillars of OOP, we now encounter . The term  originates from the Greek words  (many) and  (forms), signifying "many forms". In the realm of object-oriented programming,  denotes an object's ability to assume multiple forms.To comprehend , let's consider a . It can play various types of music files, such as , , or . Each of these file types is different, yet our music player can handle all of them. This is akin to  in object-oriented programming. is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a single interface to represent multiple underlying forms (classes) and enables objects to be processed in a generic manner.In C#, there are two types of :, also known as , allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. The compiler determines which method to invoke based on the number and types of arguments.Here's an example of  in C#:In this example, the  class has three  methods with the same name but different parameters. This is an example of  in C#., also known as , allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.Here's an example of  in C#:In this example, the  class has a virtual method . The  and  classes override the  method with specific implementations for playing MP3 and WAV music, respectively. This is an example of  in C#.Let's see how  can be used in a program:In this code snippet, we created an object of the  class and assigned it to a variable of type . We then called the  method on the  object, which invokes the overridden  method in the  class. We then created an object of the  class and assigned it to the  variable. When we call the  method again, it invokes the overridden  method in the  class.Congratulations! You have learned about  and how it is implemented in C#. Let's move on to the final pillar of OOP, .As we delve into the final pillar of OOP, we encounter .  is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It emphasizes on what an object does rather than how it does it.To comprehend , let's consider a . When you use a smartphone, you don't need to understand the intricacies of how the internal components like the  or the  work. You only need to know how to interact with the user interface to make calls, send messages, or use apps. This is akin to  in object-oriented programming. is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to create a blueprint for a class with some abstract methods that must be implemented by the derived classes. It enables you to define the structure of a class without providing the implementation details.In C#,  can be achieved using  classes and . Let's explore both concepts:An  is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. An abstract method is a method without a body that must be implemented by the derived classes.Here's an example of an  in C#:In this example, the  class is an abstract class with an abstract method . The  and  classes inherit from the  class and provide specific implementations for the  method. This is an example of  using abstract classes in C#.An  is a reference type in C# that defines a contract for classes to implement. It contains only the declaration of the methods, properties, events, or indexers, without providing the implementation.Here's an example of an  in C#:In this example, the  interface defines a contract with a method . The  and  classes implement the  interface and provide specific implementations for the  method. This is an example of  using interfaces in C#.Congratulations! You have now learned about  and how it is implemented in C#. The key takeaway is that  allows us to hide the complexity of the system and expose only the necessary details to the user.In this article, we have explored the four fundamental pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#: , , , and .These pillars form the foundation of OOP and are essential concepts to understand when working with object-oriented programming languages like C#.
