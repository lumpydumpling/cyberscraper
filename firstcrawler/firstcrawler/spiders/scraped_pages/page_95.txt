Title: Form W-2 data thefts are rocketing, warns FBI
Text Content: The Home of the Security Bloggers NetworkHomeCybersecurityData SecurityBusinesses beware! Online criminals have ramped up their attempts to steal W-2 information from the finance and human resources departments of organisations, according to a warning issued by the FBI.In an alert issued last week, the FBI warned that it had observed a significant increase in reports from companies who had received emails requesting valuable W-2 information from either spoofed or compromised email addresses.Typically an attacker might pose as a member of the targeted company’s senior management, tricking an unwitting member of staff to send them workers’ IRS W-2 tax form data.In some cases the initial communication may be a friendly, “Hi, are you working today?” that then leads to a fraudster requesting copies of all employees’ W-2 forms to be sent to them.The data held on the forms holds enormous value to criminals because a single W-2 record contains an employee’s name, address, income, and Social Security Number, alongside other personal information.The stolen information can then be used by fraudsters to file fraudulent tax returns, or sell the data on to other criminals via underground criminal websites.Although it’s possible for individuals to be targeted, it appears that more criminals are targeting businesses where there are opportunities to steal large amounts of data.The IRS reported last month that it received reports of over 200 companies who received such attacks during 2017, impacting hundreds of thousands of employees who had their identities compromised.For instance, last year we described how hackers had managed to breach the tax portal of US military contractor Northrop Grumman and gained access to workers’ W-2 paperwork for the 2016 tax year.In that case it is believed that unauthorised users were able to access the portal, run on Northrop Grumman’s behalf by Equifax, after a legitimate user’s login details were stolen.Clearly multifactor authentication or disabling access to the portal from outside the Stealth Bomber maker’s own network might have provided a higher level of protection.Other high profile corporations who have fallen foul of W-2 tax information breaches include Snapchat and Seagate, after staff were targeted by business email compromise scams.Business email compromise, also sometimes known as “whaling” or “CEO fraud,” is a growing problem. Until firms educate staff about the threats, and put measures in place to reduce the chances of criminals succeeding in spiriting away the sensitive information, you can expect to hear many more reports in the future.Here are some of the FBI’s recommendations for companies concerned that their payroll and finance personnel could be targeted by W-2-related Business Email Compromise and phishing scams:According to the FBI advisory, the IRS may be able to help protect your staff from tax-related identity theft if they are notified quickly after the data loss.*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from HOTforSecurity authored by Graham Cluley.
