Text Content: The 8th Coast Artillery Regiment was a Coast Artillery Corps regiment in the United States Army, which garrisoned the Harbor Defenses of Portland (HD Portland), Maine 1924–1944, and the Harbor Defenses of Portsmouth, New Hampshire 1924–1940.[1]The 8th Coast Artillery was constituted 27 February 1924 and organized 1 July 1924 as the Regular Army component of the Harbor Defenses of Portland (HD Portland), Maine through early 1944; the 240th Coast Artillery was the Maine National Guard component of those defenses.[1] In early 1944 most of the 8th Coast Artillery's personnel were transferred to HD Portland and the regiment was soon disbanded. The 8th CA also garrisoned the Harbor Defenses of Portsmouth, New Hampshire at caretaker strength from 1924 through early 1940. At that time the 22nd Coast Artillery was activated from personnel of the HD Portsmouth caretaker detachment, relieving the 8th Coast Artillery of that duty.[3]The lineage of the 8th Coast Artillery is as follows:Constituted 27 February 1924 as the 8th Coast Artillery (HD) Regiment, and organized at Fort Preble 1 July 1924 by redesignating the 123rd, 154th, 155th, 171st, 196th, 156th, 246th, and 251st companies of Coast Artillery Corps.
