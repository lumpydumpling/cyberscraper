Quickstart to launch a Solace PubSub+ Software Event Broker in OpenShift      The Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Operator (Operator) is a Kubernetes-native method to install and manage the lifecycle of a PubSub+ Software Event Broker on any Kubernetes platform including OpenShift.Note: We recommend using the PubSub+ Event Broker Operator. An alternative method using Helm is also available from an earlier version of this repo.This repository extends the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Operator on Kubernetes guide, providing additional specific instructions for the OpenShift 4 Platform.Contents:Solace PubSub+ Platform is a complete event streaming and management platform for the real-time enterprise. The PubSub+ Software Event Broker efficiently streams event-driven information between applications, IoT devices, and user interfaces running in the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid environments using open APIs and protocols like AMQP, JMS, MQTT, REST and WebSocket. It can be installed into a variety of public and private clouds, PaaS, and on-premises environments. Event brokers in multiple locations can be linked together in an Event Mesh to dynamically share events across the distributed enterprise.This project is a best practice template intended for development and demo purposes. It has been tested using OpenShift v4.13. The tested and recommended PubSub+ Software Event Broker version is 10.4.This document provides a quick getting started guide to install the broker in various configurations onto an OpenShift 4 platform.For additional documentation, see /docs/PubSubPlusOpenShiftDeployment.md in this repo.There are multiple ways to set up an OpenShift 4 deployment, including the following examples:The certified PubSub+ Event Broker Operator is available in OpenShift from the integrated OperatorHub catalog. Follow Adding Operators to a cluster in the OpenShift documentation to locate and install the "PubSub+ Event Broker Operator".Create a new OpenShift project. It is not recommended to use the  project.From here follow the steps in the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Operator Quick Start Guide to deploy a single-node or an HA event broker.Note: the Operator recognizes the OpenShift environment and adjusts the default deployment  parameters for the event broker, including the use of certified RedHat images.
