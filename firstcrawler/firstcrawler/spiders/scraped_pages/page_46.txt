Title: Wikipedia:Category names
Text Content: This page contains a list of guidelines concerning naming conventions for categories. If you wish to propose a new naming convention for categories or modify an existing convention, please do so on the talk page.When naming a category, one should be particularly careful and choose its name accurately. Moving non-conventionally categorized pages to another category name (see {{Category redirect}}) imposes an additional overhead – an edit for  article and subcategory. Also, try to avoid names that are too long or too short.  Short, straight-forward names, are preferred for categories, though it may be necessary at times to deviate from this principle for clarity or disambiguation.For categorizing people by ancestry or ethnicity, the format is: "FOOian people of BARian descent", where "FOOian" is the person's nationality (country of citizenship) and "BARian" is the person's ethnic ancestry (such as Category:Irish people of Ghanaian descent and Category:American people of German descent).Currently, Wikipedia supports categorizing people by occupation, such as: People by educational institution and People by company, as well as other more specific categories.For categorizing people by occupation, the format is: FOOs, where FOO is the occupation name (such as Category:Editors); or People in FOO or FOO people, where FOO is the topic of the occupation (such as Category:People in agriculture‎ or Category:Music people).Occupation categories should not be divided into "current" or "former" categories. For example, Category:Former child actors and Category:Current Minnesota Twins players should not exist.For categorizing people by place of residence, the format is: People from Foo (not "Natives of Foo"). Where the commonly used English name for residents of a place is well-known globally (usually the original place of that name), Fooite demonym categories should be {{category redirect}}ed to People from Foo, in order to assist with automated categorization (for example, Category:New Yorkers).For categorizing people by place of burial, the format is: Burials at Foo Cemetery.By convention, a category name designating a time period with a number (in Arabic numerals) represents a calendar year in the Common Era. For categorizing people by years BCE, the format is: "<year number> BC", for example Category:220 BC deaths.For categorizing people by century, the format is: Category:xx-century foos or Category:xx-century BC foos.All categories whose subcategories are categories by country (roughly all categories that are members of Category:Categories by country) shall have a per-category naming convention which will apply to all of their subcategories. These naming conventions, their guidelines and their exceptions are listed here. Non-conformance to these naming conventions shall be treated as a criterion for "speedy category renaming" as defined on WP:CFD.Categories regarding events in countries (along with years and time) are named "... in country." This guideline applies to:MillenniaCenturiesDecadesYearsEstablishmentsDisestablishmentsFor categorizing permanently located manufactured objects by country, the format is: "... in country".

See the talk page for details.  These will be moved up as consensus develops.For "of country" and "in country" categories, the name of the country should appear as it does in the name of the article about that country, with a lowercase "the" if needed for grammatical purposes.  Non-sovereign, disputed, supranational, and historical countries and geographic equivalents may be included if the articles to be categorized require it.  For reference, see List of sovereign states, List of dependent territories, and the following list.In category naming, country names should not be abbreviated (except to the extent that they are already in their respective article titles - for example, "United Kingdom", but not "UK" or "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").(Note: Links to articles are shown only for reference; links obviously cannot appear in the actual title of a category.)Supranational:Historical: When historical and political complexities (such as mergers and splits) create articles that belong to two countries, do not create a "Foo of X and Y".  Instead, list articles in both "Foo of X" and "Foo of Y"; for example, "Foo of Russia" and "Foo of the Soviet Union", not "Foo of Russia and the Soviet Union". The same applies for geographic features that cross national borders, for example "Foo of the United States" and "Foo of Canada", not "Foo of the United States and Canada".All categories whose subcategories are categories by nationality (roughly all categories that are members of Category:People by nationality or Category:Works by nationality) shall have a per-category naming convention which will apply to all of their subcategories. These naming conventions, their guidelines and their exceptions are listed here. Non-conformance to these naming conventions shall be treated as a criterion for "speedy category renaming" as defined on WP:CFD. Changing these conventions shall require a consensual discussion either directly at WP:CFD or publicized there. National subcategories of these categories are named using the nationality rather than the country name, as they follow the national diasporas. However, the container categories are named "by country", e.g. Category:Art by country and Category:Culture by country.[1]ArtCuisineCultureLiteratureMusicPlaysNote that many other sub-topics of "Society" are named using the country name, and so are some cultural topics e.g. Architecture and Classical music.For categorizing subcategories of People by nationality, the format is: "nationality ...".MurderersMusical groupsPeople by nationality and occupationPeople by occupation and nationalityPeopleFor categorizing people by their nationality and occupation, the format is: "fooian fooers", such as Category:Ethiopian musicians. Concurrent citizenship may be reflected by categorizing the article by each nationality. For example, Category:Canadian actors and Category:American actors for a dual American–Canadian citizen. Categories that combine two nationalities with an occupation, generally should not be created.The category description should mention the most commonly used names ("Fooians", or "Fooers"), which can be found in verifiable reliable sources. The template {{Fooian fooers}} can be used to provide navigation on each category page. For example:A list of adjectival forms of place names is available on Wikipedia. In situations where multiple adjectives are possible for a particular nationality (e.g., Argentine vs. Argentinean), discussions at categories for discussion have frequently opted for one alternative over another to ensure consistency in category naming. Note that the singular-form demonym and adjective for many nationalities are not interchangeable. (i.e., Icelander vs. Icelandic; New Zealander vs. New Zealand). Most category names use the adjectival form, not the noun-form demonym.Some states do not possess unambiguous (i.e., "Congolese" for Democratic Republic of the Congo) or universally-applicable (i.e., "Bosnian" for Bosnia and Herzegovina) adjectives. In these circumstances, the format is: "Country FOO", where  is the unamended name of the country.The list below reflects the most recent consensuses on what form to use for particular nationalities. These adopted forms may be subject to change by consensus and proposals to do so can be made by nominating the affected categories at categories for discussion. References are included to discussions that have discussed particular name formats.In general, the formats for people of former nationalities is less settled. The list below represents examples which are reasonably well settled. After September 2022, "of" is now deprecated and "from" will become the standard for former countries that have compound names.[103]Therefore, for categorizing people of former nationalities with a compound name, the format is: "FOOs from Country".All categories whose subcategories are categories by creative artist (roughly all categories that are members of Category:Works by artist) shall have a per-category naming convention which will apply to all of their subcategories. These naming conventions, their guidelines and their exceptions are listed here. Non-conformance to these naming conventions shall be treated as a criterion for "speedy category renaming" as defined at WP:CFD. Changing these conventions shall require a consensual discussion either directly at WP:CFD or publicized there. For categorizing music by composer, the format is: "Compositions by [composer]".Compositions by composerOperas by composerSymphonies by composerSongs by composerFor categorizing music by performer, the format is: "[Performer] works".Albums by artistSongs by artistFor categorizing articles of each type of work of an artist, the format is: "[type of work]s by [artist]" (for example, Category:Paintings by Salvador Dalí). For categorizing subcategories of different types of work of an artist (for example, for paintings and sculpture), the format for the parent category is: "Works by Foo".Paintings by artistSculptures by artistFor categorizing architecture by architect, the format is: "[Architect] buildings", with exceptions for architects involved in more than one type of work.Buildings and structures by architectFor categorizing literature by writer, the format is: "[Work]s by [writer]".Works by writerNovels by writerBooks by writerEssay collections by writerEssays by writerPicture books by writerPlays by writerPoetry by writerShort stories by writerShort story collections by writerFor categorizing stage and screen works by contributor, the format is: "[Works] by [person]".Films by directorFilms by screenwriterPlays by writerTelevision shows by writerThe name used should match the name of the biography article about the person, including any disambiguator, e.g. Category:Books by Peter Carey (novelist). The only exceptions are categories for visual arts, where the name used for the artist may instead match usage within the articles on the works; e.g. Category:Paintings by Sergei Ivanovich Osipov does not have to follow the article name Sergei Osipov (artist).[115]Category names of a subject should match the name for that subject within articles and citations (including spelling and capitalisation), rather than the name of the Wikipedia article on the topic.
