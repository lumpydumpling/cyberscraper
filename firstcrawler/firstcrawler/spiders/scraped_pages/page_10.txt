Title: Template talk:Linux distributions
Text Content: Slax 7 and above are based on Debian instead of Slackware. Change happened in 2017 and this template should reflect that. I'd change it myself but I don't have enough edits on my account to change this page. --Thismachinechills (talk) 01:25, 9 May 2020 (UTC)replyNumber of Google hits in millions, rounded by million, of the Linux distributions from DistroWatch's top 20. Taken from Google Linux at 20100601.Numbers can vary.The article the title links to is named Linux Distribution. Creating a redirection because some people view GNU/Linux as "more" proper isn't the way to go about things. If you want the name changed to GNU/Linux then you need to change Linux distribution and Linux to GNU/Linux also. This template is going to mirror the name that those articles are given whether you like it or not. I'm also requesting page protection as an editor war is not happening. --Koolabsol (talk) 21:31, 18 March 2010 (UTC)replyFrom: Talk:Linux "Merge this article with Linux distribution: No, this is a WP:SUMMARY style article for the broader Linux pictureCan we rename this page to GNU/Linux? No, the vast majority of people and companies call it Linux, and we already mention the alternate name in the lead and its own subsection.Do we need the GNU history? Yes, GNU played an important role in the development of Linux as we know it today." While I think that is bullshit and the correct term  GNU/Linux, they have locked the article with the current name. The title will be Linux distribution as long as Linux is Linux and Linux distribution is Linux distribution. I can not do anything about it and being immature about it and changing the title of the Linux distributions template to use the correct terminology while you can not do anything about the other, more prominent title errors will not get anyone anywhere. If you bring this up with an administrator and fix the problem at the root then naturally the title will be changed to the proper name. Otherwise, you will have to let things be. --Koolabsol (talk) 01:59, 19 March 2010 (UTC)replyThese edits completely changed the template. I'm going to undo some of it based on general notability. --Joy [shallot] (talk) 10:32, 21 April 2010 (UTC)replyLooking at:There's a notable discrepancy between some of the navbox content and reality. I'm looking at ditching everything with less than 50k google+linux hits and below 25 on distrowatch. --Joy [shallot] (talk) 10:36, 21 April 2010 (UTC)replyI removed all of those and then a few more. Thoughts welcome. --Joy [shallot] (talk) 10:47, 21 April 2010 (UTC)replyJust now I removed another three distributions for which I could barely find proof of significance based on the above criteria. Two of them had really generic names and their Google search results were practically worthless, even when searched under quotes, because the two words could easily form part of a generic sentence. --Joy [shallot] (talk) 12:31, 23 April 2010 (UTC)replyI think we could use another simple criteria - an article can't be linked from the infobox until its article gets at least a handful of barely encyclopedic references... --Joy [shallot] (talk) 12:31, 23 April 2010 (UTC)replySome leftovers that might need to be removed:--Joy [shallot] (talk) 12:40, 23 April 2010 (UTC)replyI don't think CrunchBang is suitable. Koolabsol said  but the problem is:Not even a normal Google search has more than 167,000. It looks like a bug/feature of the special Linux search. --Joy [shallot] (talk) 20:26, 25 April 2010 (UTC)replyAfter having to police a continuous stream of largely bad edits over the last few weeks, I've skimmed over the template history once again, and it seems to me that all we have is trouble. Does anyone object to protecting it from editing, at least by anonymous/unconfirmed users, since it's apparently a sufficiently highly visible template that it attracts a lot of problems? --Joy [shallot] (talk) 08:33, 13 May 2010 (UTC)replyUser:Chealer has reverted the template back to the way it used to be.[1] Thinking his edits were in good faith and mistaken I reverted them in good faith.[2] He has reverted the template back once again[3] and I am putting a notice on the talk page so that others can weigh in on this. I will not be reverting any more edits as that would most likely lead to an edit war. Discuss. --Koolabsol (talk) 03:03, 9 June 2010 (UTC)replyI think there should be more distros added to the template. There is no sound reason to only include 10 or so popular distros, when 20, 30 or even 40 could easily be included without taking up too much space. Compared to other templates it would still be rather moderate in size. I'm specifically missing distros like Sabayon, SLAX, Zenwalk and Backtrack which are quite popular and/or respected. It would also be a good idea to create sections and sub-sections to reflect the evolution and relationship of different distros.Of course I'm aware of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions, but the template should be improved nevertheless in order to provide the core information at one glance.unsigned217.85.186.107talkcontribsThis template could use a marker to indicate discontinued distributions that might still be notable (for now) enough to be included. There could eg. be a small dagger after the name: Mandriva, Antergos...
